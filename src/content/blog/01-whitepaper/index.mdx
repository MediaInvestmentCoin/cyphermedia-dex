# Introduction

## Ecosystem

LamboDoge is not only a token, it's a whole ecosystem relying on 2 major components:

- **(token) LamboDoge:** A BEP-20 token, used to reward liquidity providers, stakers and holders.
- **(app) LamboSwap:** It consists of multiple Decentralized Finance (DeFi) products deployed on the Binance Smart Chain.

LamboSwap and LamboDoge features are interdependent and it's through their combination that the ecosystem makes sense.

*All LambdoDoge products are 100% open source, you can find the code on [github](https://github.com/lamboDoge/).*

## Tax

The main innovation brought by LamboDoge is its tax management. LamboDoge doesnâ€™t take a tax on each transaction but on each buy or sell,
which lets you manage and use your tokens in a more user friendly way, and unlock a lot of new scaling possibilities, such as intergration
into DeFi protocols.

LamboDoge also has a specific way to handle its tax, in order to reduce the price impact of each transaction,
we've developed a progressive tax correlated to the transaction's price impact and nature.
The tool bellow simulate the tax percentage and its repartition according to these factors.

*As you can see, fees are higher on sale than buy.*

## Tokenomics

LamboDoge has a max supply of 100,000,000,000 tokens. They are distributed through the dead address, liquidity pools, staking pools and
vaults that will be unlocked periodically to increase the reward rate of liquidity mining and staking pools,
and develop new products on LamboSwap

Here are the details and percentages about the initial distribution:

- 40 billion tokens (50%) are splitted into 4 vault time locked. Each of them contains 10B tokens.
We will unlock 1 vault monthly, starting on the 19th of October.
- 20 billion tokens (20%) were sent to the PancakeSwap liquidity pool.
- 12 billion tokens (12%) will be used to reward liquidity miners.
- 10 billion tokens (10%) were burned to the [vault creator](https://bscscan.com/address/0x08ec88cc52edf0fff9b7672d4c640a915a7021bb) address.
- 8 billion tokens (8%) will be used to reward LamboDoge stakers.
- 6 billion tokens (6%) are splitted into 4 multisig vaults of 1.5B token each. Those tokens represent the team tokens.
- 4 billion tokens (4%) were burned to the [dead address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).

# DeFi with LamboSwap

The main products provided by LamboSwap are its swapping interface, and the staking platform.

## Swapping interface

On its first version, the swapping interface of LamboSwap uses the PancakeSwap protocol.
Which allows you to trade any BEP-20 tokens with liquidity on PancakeSwap. But in comparison to the PancakeSwap interface,
LamboSwap is much more user friendly and testnet compatible.

LamboSwap also allows you to provide, manage and remove liquidity.

## Staking and liquidity mining

One of our goals is to keep the price up and increase the price floor of LamboDoge. In order to achieve this,
we've added a staking platform to LamboSwap.

The staking principle is kinda simple, you deposit some tokens into a pool and you're rewarded with some other tokens until
you withdraw your deposited tokens.

At launch, LamboSwap offers 2 staking pools, one "classic pool", and one "liquidity mining pool". Let's break down these concepts and explain
why it will help us to achieve our goals.

## Classic staking

The available "classic pool" on LamboSwap allows users to stake their `LDOGE`, rewards them with `LDOGE`,
and a tax is applied when a user deposits or withdraw his `LDOGE`. This tax is entirely added to the staking pool, as a reward.

- 2% on deposit
- 4% on withdrawn

The purpose of this pool is to incentivize `LDOGE` holders to not sell their tokens. Due to the tax described above,
once a holder stakes his `LDOGE`, he will have to wait a few days before starting to receive his return on investment,
this mechanism adds an additional psychological cost to the sale.

## Liquidity mining

The available "liquidity mining pool" on LamboSwap allows users to stake their `LP-LDOGE-BNB` tokens and rewards them with `LDOGE`.

When a user provides liquidity on a pair, he will receive a certain amount of LP token in exchange. These tokens represents
his share of the liquidity pool.

The more liquidity a pair own, the more stable the price is. However, liquidity providing can leads to a loss of capital due to
[impermanent losses](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/). That's where liquidity mining comes on the scene.
By allowing liquidity providers to stake their LP tokens into highly enough rewarding pools to counterbalance the risk of capital losses
inherent to liquidity providing.

That's why the liquidity mining `LP-LDOGE-BNB` pool offers 50% more rewards than the classic `LDOGE` pool.
